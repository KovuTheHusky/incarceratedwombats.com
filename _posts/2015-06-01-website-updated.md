Hello fellow wombats!

The videos page has been removed and now we have a [Practices](/practices) page that includes all of those videos along with all of our older audio-only recordings.

I also did some digging and found recordings from way back in 2008! You'll also find two videos from 2009 have been added along with two videos from October 5, 2012. I should also be putting up one more from Febuary 1, 2012 soon. After that we should be all caught up. It will be really cool to have everything ever recorded on the website.

Hopefully our guitarist will turn up again and we'll be able to jam together.
