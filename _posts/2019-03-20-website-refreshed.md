Hello, long lost wombats.

This is a long due update. The website has been refreshed and all of our recordings (video & audio) are now hosted on YouTube. Now long after we're all dead our legacy will live on so others may follow the wombat.

We're all feeling nostalgic for the days when we would practice every week. Perhaps something will come together and we will all return to the warm embrace of the wombat.
