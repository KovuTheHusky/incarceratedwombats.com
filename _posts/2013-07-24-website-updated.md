Hey everybody - just want to write a quick post about some new features and fixes on the website.

We've added a link to our new Google+ page on the home page and we now have our RSS feed working. If you have an RSS reader you can subscribe to our new posts! We've also updated the videos page to only show five videos per page. There are also a bunch of minor fixes that should make using the website easier. Hope you enjoy the updates!
