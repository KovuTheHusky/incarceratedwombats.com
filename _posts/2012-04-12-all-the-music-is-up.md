title:  "All the music is up"

Just wanted to give a quick shout saying that all the music is up. I consolidated the Archives and Riffs page so now it's all together on the Archives page.

As long as everybody shows up Friday we'll do a group shot for the website and individual shots for the Band page. We should also settle on an album name, the cover art, and the song order.
