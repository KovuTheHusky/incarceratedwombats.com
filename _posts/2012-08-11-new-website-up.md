Or should I say wombsite?

The music page will be updated soon with our first album information. For now, why not go and like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter and YouTube?

There are some new pictures up too. See the most recent five on the right side of this page or head over to the pictures page to see them all.

May the wombat be with you!
